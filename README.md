# Healthcare Patient Management Tech Test

This project is a tech test designed to evaluate your ability to implement a small but well-structured application. It's built using the T3 Stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Drizzle ORM). This is intended for Full-stack Engineers therefore avoid implementing everything on the client / browser. 

## Project Overview

You'll be building a simplified patient management system focusing on appointment scheduling and basic patient information management. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to write clean, maintainable code with proper separation of concerns.

### Assessment Steps

1. **Get it running**
   - Clone the repository and set up the development environment
   - Install dependencies and start the development server, identifying and resolving any issues

2. **Create and seed the database ðŸŒ±**
   - The repository contains nearly everything you'll need to get a database up and running
   - Implement the database schema and seed the `patients` table with initial data

3. **List patients and view their details ðŸš¨**
   - List out patients on the home page
   - Implement a patient details view

4. **Add appointments to patients ðŸš¨**
   - Create functionality to add new appointments for each patient
   - Bonus points for displaying appointments on the same page

### Technical Focus Areas

See this short list as our ordered priorities for the assessment. At this stage we're more interested in how you implement a database call over how you'd style a patient card.


1. **Architecture & Patterns**
   - Remember that this is a full-stack role.

2. **Data Management**

3. **UI/UX**

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
1. Create enviornment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Time Management

We respect your time and wouldn't expect you to spend any more than 3 hours on this assessment. The instructions are intentionally vague to allow you to use your best judgement. As much as this is a small assessment, please assume that we're looking for scaleable, performant and maintainable code.

## Getting Help

Part of the assessment is overcoming obstacles, but if you find yourself stuck, we'd much prefer you to reach out for help. The team are available at [engineering@lutrahealth.com](mailto:engineering@lutrahealth.com) and would be more than happy to help you out.

## Submission

Either host your solution on your GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket account and email us the link, or zip it up and email it to us.

- If you are zipping it up, please do not include your `node_modules` file!
- Email [engineering@lutrahealth.com](mailto:engineering@lutrahealth.com)

## Notes for Candidates

- We work with sensitive personal data
- Document any architectural decisions
- Consider maintainability and scalability

Good luck ðŸŽ‰
